            <p class="host-words wow fadeInUp">   <!-- We, as humans have an innate tendency to take 'reality' and 'perception' for granted. We never trouble ourselves to question what is 'real' to us, until we are faced by some problem or consequences. Normally humans would define what is real as what they perceive through the lens of belief and background, which differ from person-to-person. But don't you think that visualising things through this lens gives us a different picture of the world than what is the true 'reality'?<br>
            It is this reality which we want everyone to decipher. Not through any lens, but after critical analysis of what is presented to them. Because when we can see through all the barriers of social restrictions, we will be able to bring better and holistic solutions for the world.

-->With a few folds from a creative mind, a blank paper can be transformed into colourful planes which soar through the skies. These paper planes are reminiscent of how even simple beginnings can lead to unimaginable things. 
TEDxBITSPilani aims to celebrate this aspect of ideas, their conception and purpose, rather than the prevalence of the idea in the moment  because however fragile they are, all of them do fly against the winds to reach their destinies.

                                <p>TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas worth Spreading, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less) which can be described as &ldquo;the ultimate brain spa&rdquo;. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics &mdash; in more than 100 languages. </p>
                                <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world&rsquo;s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.
                                </p>
                                <p>TED&rsquo;s media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.

                                <p>TED has established the annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize">TED Prize</a>
                                    , where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

                                <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

                                <p>TEDx was created in the spirit of TED's mission, "ideas worth spreading."

TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, under a free license granted by TED.

                             A pioneering Indian astrophysicist, the former head of Theoretical Physics Section at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, and 
                                currently an (Hon) Adjunct Professor at Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai.Known for his distinct views, Dr Mitra has regularly 
                                questioned the mainstream cosmological concepts such as the Big Bang, Dark Energy and Black Holes; his claims have been backed by several 
                                scientists across the globe. Scientists have come to favour his claims over resolution of the “black hole information paradox”, which was 
                                presented 13 years before Stephen Hawking. On July 25, 2006, Center for Astrophysics, Harvard, issued a Press Release mentioning his 
                                original idea.It is extremely rare in Indian Science in post-independent India, that a fundamental idea developed within India has been 
                                the topic of a press release by Harvard or any Ivy-league institute. One of the leading speakers on Theoretical Physics, Dr Mitra has also 
                                shared this honour with few Nobel Laureates; and in 2017, DST India invited him to the Nobel Laureate Symposium at the Vibrant Gujarat 
                                Festival. He is accredited with the setting up of Himalayan Gamma Ray Observatory and initiating research in Theoretical Astrophysics both 
                                in J&K and in BARC way back in the 1980s! He continues to empower aspiring astrophysicists all over India and has a book entitled "The Rise 
                                & Fall of the Black Hole Paradigm" coming out in 2018.

                                She brought the same passion and love of the game to India, as the founder and head of Hockey Village India and also started a primary 
                                English medium school to provide better education to the kids. Hockey Village India, first started in Garh Himmat Singh village, from 
                                where she was forced to flee because the villagers were made to believe that the German lady would use her school to convert the kids 
                                into Christianity and 'westernise' them, the rumour gave ammunition and she fell victim to the politics. Despite battling suspicion, tackling bureaucratic apathy and struggling for sponsors to continue with her passion to teach hockey to the kids, sticking to her guns, Andrea relocated to a nearby village and since then she has coached 7 kids from the NGO to play in junior German league and took 5 of her students to Germany to practise in professional playgrounds and meet other players. Five of Andrea’s girls were even selected for the state team in the Under-16 category.

                                in painting but branched out into other mediums of artistic expression. In early 2017, Rahal worked on art installations spread out 
                                across Liverpool city, with objects made using scrap metal and wood that he found. Followed by, exhibitions in Glasgow, Scotland, which 
                                were featured in 'The Week's Top Exhibition' in the UK. Rahal's artworks are as much science fiction and fantasy as they are weird and 
                                wonderful. Art might be his first love, but storytelling is equally integral to this 28-year-old’s practice. Working with film, 
                                performances and installations, Rahal’s eclectic style has created waves both across the Indian art scene as well as internationally as 
                                he travels the world telling tales about everything from history and culture, to religion, science and fantasy. He has been a recipient 
                                of many prestigious international residencies and won the Forbes Award for Debut Solo Show, 2014. Rahal continues to challenge the 
                                notions of conventional art, which makes his voice continuously important one, both in and around the spaces that define today’s art

Scientists have come to favour his claims over resolution of the “black hole information paradox”, which was presented 13 years before Stephen Hawking. On July 25, 2006, Center for Astrophysics, Harvard, issued a Press Release mentioning his original idea.It is extremely rare in Indian Science in post-independent India, that a fundamental idea developed within India has been the topic of a press release by Harvard or any Ivy-league institute. One of the leading speakers on Theoretical Physics, Dr Mitra has also shared this honour with few Nobel Laureates; and in 2017, DST India invited him to the Nobel Laureate Symposium at the Vibrant Gujarat Festival. He is accredited with the setting up of Himalayan Gamma Ray Observatory and initiating research in Theoretical Astrophysics both in J&K and in BARC way back in the 1980s!
